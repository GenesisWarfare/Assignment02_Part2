## Project Overview
This Unity project was created as part of Assignment 02 – Part 2.  
It is a simple 2D platformer featuring player movement with arrow keys and a mini-map in the top-right corner.  
The project demonstrates basic Unity behaviors including input handling using the new Input System, orthographic camera control, and UI overlay elements.

## Features

- **Player Movement:** Move a square character up, down, left, and right using the new Input System. Speed is adjustable in the Inspector. Gravity can be toggled on or off.
- **Mini-Map:** Shows the player’s location on a top-right overlay, using a secondary camera.
- **Camera Rotation Simulation:** Includes a “Rotate” button to simulate changing device orientation between landscape and portrait.
- **Orthographic Camera Scaling:** Ensures objects appear the same size regardless of simulated rotation.
